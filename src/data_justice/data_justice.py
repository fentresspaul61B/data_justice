# Data Ethics Agreement



Thank you for including the Data Ethics Agreement in your project. The goal is to certify that the collection and use of data has been ethical and just, and that in your analysis, you have the time to pay deference to those who are often marginalized in the data lifecycle. Please use this opportunity both to provide accountability for those who use the data project in the future, and to consider the vulnerabilities in data usage. Before completing the agreement, please review the linked video(or resource/fact sheet?) for more information regarding data justice.

<font color='Green'>Type your response here. please provide a response for every dataset used.</font>





### <font color="#b39200">REASONS FOR DATA USAGE SCORING: Scale (0-3)</font>

### <font color="#b39200">Type your response here. please provide a response for every dataset used.</font>



<font color="#b39200">**Score = 0**</font>


<font color="#b39200">The reasons for using this data are vulnerable to exploiting marginalized groups and perspective, and this project should be should not be used for future reference. Negative impact on people. The data may reenforce racial, social, or economic biases, and moves away from justice.</font>



<font color="#b39200">**Score = 1**</font>


<font color="#b39200">Reasons for using this data are irrelevant to justice. No clear positive impact on data justice arises from using this project. Or, using this project can possibly be harmful.</font>



<font color="#b39200">**Score = 2**</font>


<font color="#b39200">The reasons for using this data are sufficiently justifiable. Neutral or slightly positive impact. It will likely have a neutral or positive impact on the world. The project is clear in its intention for maintaining justice, and does not pose a significant risk of being exploited.</font>



<font color="#b39200">**Score = 3**</font>


<font color="#b39200">The reasons for using this data are undoubtedly beneficial and contribute positively to the world. The reason for using this data is to reduce small to large-scale suffering or promote justice. There is little to no debate about the positive impacts of this data/project.</font>




### DATA USAGE SCORE: (<font color='Green'>Put your score here.</font>)



# Data Privacy and Consent:


<font color="#b39200">Consider the distinction between times when protecting identity requires privacy and anonymity, and when protecting identity requires including more context in a dataset; if judgement claims are derived from the data project, then consider how and how much information about data should be included to prevent bias or even ignorance regarding extraneous factors and conditions which impact data results.



### How is the data managed/stored? Does it protect the privacy of the individuals included within it?



<font color='Green'>Type your response here. please provide a response for every dataset used.



### Have the subjects in the data given consent?


<font color="#b39200">Consent should be informed(consenters know what they’re consenting to), unambiguous, un-coerced, and may be revocable in some cases.



<font color='Green'> Informed: yes/no



<font color='Green'>Unambiguous: yes/no</font>

 <font color='Green'>Un-coerced: yes/no</font>


 <font color='Green'>Can the consent be revocable? What might lead to that decision?


<font color='Green'>Type your response here. please provide a response for every dataset used.




### Is personal information shown to the public?



<font color='Green'>Type your response here. please provide a response for every dataset used.


### <font color="#b39200">DATA PRIVACY AND CONSENT SCORING: Scale: (0-3)



<font color="#b39200">**Score = 0**


<font color="#b39200">
Personal information is shared about people in the data where there is no consent, or not all pillars of consent are met. The data is not secure, and people could possibly be contacted, stalked, or harassed as a result of this data/project existing publicly.


<font color="#b39200">**Score = 1**


<font color="#b39200">
Consent may have been granted at some point, but it's not clear. Personal information is weakly secured.


<font color="#b39200">**Score = 2**


<font color="#b39200">
Consent was clearly granted, and there is some data privacy in place.


<font color="#b39200">**Score = 3**


<font color="#b39200">
Consent was clearly granted, and there is strong data privacy in place. It will be difficult or impossible to track down who is included in the data. Protecting an individual's identity is undoubtedly a priority.

# **THE FOUR ANALYTICAL LENSES**


<font color="#b39200">
It is important to consider the way we relate to our data when producing projects, and as you participate in the data life cycle. This can be done through the following four analytical lenses; please take a moment before completing the Data Ethics Agreement to provide short analysis with each lense.*



## Positionality:


<font color="#b39200">
*Often times, a data practitioner is removed from the context of the data they use, is only confronted with its content and how to manipulate it. While this can be touted as helpful insofar as it allows more efficiency on the part of a practitioner, using cleaned datasets, it also inhibits the practitioner and users of a data project from recognizing what went into data collection, who’s data is being manipulated, and what impact that instance of data use may have on different groups – particularly those from where the data was collected. **Does your project provide relevant information regarding your position related to the data collected and analyzed, and does it acknowledge the limits that creates?***



<font color='Green'>Type your response here. please provide a response for every dataset used.



## **Power:**


<font color="#b39200">
*We should recognize the way data and data technology is connected to conceptions of property, and the way property as technology has historically been used to perpetuate and contribute to injustice. Once data is collected from a person or group, its use is out of their control. Historic examples are aplenty and extend across technology systems. Getting consent from people whose data is collected and used is a good start, but **how have you attempted to prevent the misuse of the power dynamics at play in your project?***



<font color='Green'>Type your response here. please provide a response for every dataset used.



## **Sociotechnical Systems:**


<font color="#b39200">
The Agreement’s *goal is to remind data practitioners of the social component to the technical systems they create. Selbst, boyd, Friedler, Venkatasubramanian, and Vertes [discuss](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3287560.3287598) various “traps” a practitioner may fall into regarding machine learning projects, by which the social component is taken for granted or stripped from the foreground of a project – which is inherently sociotechnical. </font>

**<font color="#b39200">
In what ways does your project avoid those traps, and acknowledge the sociotechnical system it contributes to?**



<font color='Green'>Type your response here. please provide a response for every dataset used.



## **Narratives:**


<font color="#b39200">
The narrative of a person, community or identity can be explored as property: it is held collectively by everyone who engages with it, but which impacts them it refers to most significantly. The Data Ethics Agreement is an attempt to mitigate harmful impacts on a person or group’s narrative by a data project – whether intended or not.
</font>

**<font color="#b39200">
How do you expect your project will affect the narrative of those it relates to?**
